## Post-Install

### Incus Admin Group

Make sure to add your user to the `incus-admin` group:

```bash
usermod -aG incus-admin `whoami`
```

Logout or reboot for the group membership to take effect.

### Sub UID and Sub GID

You also need to edit `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` to add two sets of ID maps.

The first set allows Incus to create unprivileged containers as `root`:

```bash
echo "root:1000000:1000000000" | sudo tee -a /etc/subuid /etc/subgid
```

The second set allows Incus to map your user ID on to host to your user in the container to allow for seamless file sharing.

```bash
echo "root:1000:1" | sudo tee -a /etc/subuid /etc/subgid
```

## Test Incus

Before running `blincus`, make sure Incus is ready. Start a container:

```bash
incus launch images:ubuntu/22.04 mytest 
```

If the launch succeeds, make sure your instance has a network connection. You can run `incus ls` to see a list of running instances and basic information about them.

```bash
incus ls

| mytest | RUNNING | 10.0.1.175 (eth0) |      | CONTAINER | 0         |
```
